Teamwork:
-We met 2 times for 4 hours in one of the library group study rooms. We did not work separately. We work on the same task at the same time.
While we were working on the tasks, firstly, We planned how to do this program and then designed this program on paper. 
After that, we started to develop the solution code on the computer. After finishing each step, we developed and tested the code. 
The times we are stuck, we get help from Şükrü Hoca. 
We used agile method throughout the development process of the solution of the assignment.
